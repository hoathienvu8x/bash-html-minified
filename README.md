# Bash script minified HTML template golang

Sometime on design template code, maybe pretty code to easy edit so when multi file so hard to edit file one by one. This script to make minified HTML when build application and publish that

To use script follow command on linux

```bash
bash minified source_html_directory destination_result
```

Or `chmod +x minified` to run command

```bash
./minified source_html_directory destination_result
```

With parameters

 1) `source_html_directory` : The source folder HTML need minified
 
 2) `destination_result` : The destination folder to store minified result

To get source please using command
